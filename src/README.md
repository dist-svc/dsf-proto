# Introduction

DSF is an approach to secure, trustworthy and distributed registration and discovery of arbitrary services, based on Public Key Cryptography for identity and Authenticity, Secret Key Cryptography for privacy, and utilising a [Kademlia-derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) [Distributed Hash Table \(DHT\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) as a supporting Database.

DSF is designed to minimize the complexity of implementing distributed services, providing a shared namespace for discovery and interacting with services. The use of a DHT allows DSF to operate in a peer-to-peer manner, without requiring common / centralised / trusted infrastructure. The use of public-key cryptography derived identifiers allows services, communication, and published data in DSF to be verified.
