DSF supports the definition of _applications_ along with application specific protocol encodings to enable the simple development of distributed applications, for example, a blog, or a broker for the Internet of Things.

_Applications_ consist of a globally unique application ID along with any application-specific page or block kinds and options.

To register an official application, a pull-request can be opened on this repository registering this information in `KINDS.yml` and describing the application-specific objects in this section.

Note that you don't need to do this to build (and use) your own application, however, this is required for DSF maintained applications.
